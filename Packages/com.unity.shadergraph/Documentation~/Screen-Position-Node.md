# Screen Position Node

## Description

Provides access to the screen position of the mesh vertex or fragment. The X and Y values represent the horizontal and vertical positions respectively. Use the **Mode** dropdown control to select the mode of the output value. The available modes are as follows:

- **Default** - Returns X and Y values that represent the normalized **Screen Position**. The normalized **Screen Position** is the **Screen Position** divided by the clip space position W component. The X and Y value ranges are between 0 and 1 with position `float2(0,0)` at the lower left corner of the screen. The Z and W values aren't used in this mode, so they're always 0. 

- **Raw** - Returns the raw **Screen Position** values, which are the **Screen Position** values before the clip space position W component is divided out. Position `float2(0,0)` is at the lower left corner of the screen. This mode is useful for projection.

- **Center** - Returns X and Y values that represent the normalized **Screen Position** offset so position `float2(0,0)` is at the center of the screen. The range of the X and Y values is â€“1 to 1. The Z and W values aren't used in this mode, so they're always 0. 

- **Tiled** - Returns **Screen Position** offset so position `float2(0,0)` is at the center of the screen and tiled using `frac`.

- **Pixel** - Returns **Screen Position** in terms of the actual pixel width and height values of the screen. In this mode, position `float2(0,0)` is at the lower left corner of the screen. Whereas the range of Default mode is always 0 to 1, the range of Pixel mode depends on the screen resolution. The Z and W values aren't used in this mode, so they're always 0.
