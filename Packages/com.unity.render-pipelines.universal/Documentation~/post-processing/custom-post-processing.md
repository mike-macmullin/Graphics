# Custom post-processing

The Universal Render Pipeline (URP) provides a variety of [post-processing effects](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@15.0/manual/integration-with-post-processing.html) that you can alter to create a particular visual effect or style. But to create a custom visual effect you must create a custom post-processing effect with the Full Screen Render Pass Renderer Feature. You can then use the effect to change a sceneâ€™s appearance, such as using a grayscale effect to indicate when a player has run out of health.
