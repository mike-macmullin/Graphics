Starting from HDRP 16, the Ray-Traced Reflections denoiser has been updated based on the ReBLUR implementation. This new algorithm now includes an anti-flickering setting that improves temporal stability and renders more coherent results from rough to smooth objects.  
This new denoiser is used in Raytracing Mode and Mixed Mode and completely replace the previous version.
